# SCRAT

This is a program I have made in python for educational purposes. The rat does not function unless you do propper ip config / portforwarding (this is to stop skids). This program shows you how to use socket and ctypes.

Subsribe to me on youtube (@SCPrograms) <3 & if you're going to skid give credits
